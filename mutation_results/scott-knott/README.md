# Scott-Knott Analsyis

We share here the R script we use to run the Scott-Knott test.

With this test, we divide the features into distinct groups having a stastically significant difference in the mean (p-value < 0.05).

We rely on an implementation of the Scott-Knott test publicy available on GitHub at [this link](https://github.com/klainfo/ScottKnottESD). 
In order to use our script, you have to install such a package.

The two csv files shared here contains the feature importance values for both the static and dynamic models, resulting from their trainig.
